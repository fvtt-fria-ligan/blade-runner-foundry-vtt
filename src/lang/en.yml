FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Sprint: >-
  You can make additional moves in a single Round by using the sprint
  action. This will then count as your action for the Round,
  meaning you can perform no other action.
  Roll MOBILITY – for each <span class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span> rolled,
  you can make one more move, in addition to your free move.
  If you fail the roll, you fall (before the second move)
  and cannot get up until your next turn.
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Crawl: >-
  If you need to move while being prone, you must crawl.
  This works like a move but counts as your action for the Round.
  You can get up at the end of your crawl (free action).
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.UnarmedAttack: Strength + Close Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.MeleeAttack: Strength + Close Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Grapple: >-
  If you grapple your opponent as a special attack
  in close combat, both you and your opponent fall
  to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon
  they were holding and cannot move. The only
  action they can perform is an attempt to break
  free – which is an action that succeeds if the
  opponent wins an opposed CLOSE COMBAT roll against
  you. While you are grappling, the only action you
  can perform (until you release your opponent) is
  a grapple attack. This works as a normal unarmed
  attack, but your target counts as restrained and
  thus cannot defend themselves.
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.BreakFree: Strength + Hand-to-hand Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.ShootFirearm: Agility + Firearms
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.CarefulAim: >-
  If you take your time to aim carefully
  before squeezing the trigger, you get an advantage to your
  attack roll. Aiming, however, is an action in itself. You
  cannot aim carefully and fire in the same Round. If you
  do anything else except shoot your weapon after you have
  aimed, or if you are hit by an attack, you lose the effect
  of the aim and you need to spend another action to aim
  carefully again.

FLBR.SignatureItemUsedCheckboxHint: Used?
FLBR.SomeoneIsSomething: '{name} is {status}'
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Crash: Crash
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.CrashHint: >-
  If a Spinner is Wrecked, it crashes violently
  to the ground. All people inside suffer D3 points of falling
  damage plus one for each zone of altitude, mitigated by
  the vehicle’s Armor rating. You can also brace yourself for
  the hit by rolling MOBILITY – each <span class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span> rolled reduces the
  damage by one.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.CrashDialog: >-
  This will crash the vehicle and inflict {damage} of falling damage to each passenger,
  mitigated by the vehicle’s Armor rating and a MOBILITY roll (no action).
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Explode: Explode
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.ExplodeHint: >-
  The vehicle explodes in a ball of flame.
  Everyone inside is exposed to a Blast Power B explosion,
  and the vehicle is destroyed beyond repair.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.MassiveCrash: Massive Crash
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Ramming: Ramming
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.RammingHint: >-
  Most vehicles can be used
  as weapons – i.e. to simply run your target over. It counts
  as a close combat attack but roll for DRIVING instead of
  CLOSE COMBAT. This roll can be combined with the speeding
  action above, but that will make the DRIVING roll an
  opposed roll, meaning that the effectiveness of the speeding
  might be reduced. The base Damage rating of the attack
  equals your vehicle’s Hull rating divided by two, rounded up.
  Ramming vehicles inflict crushing damage and the Crit
  Die has a die size equal to the Hull rating, rounded up to
  the closest die, to a maximum of D12 – i.e. a vehicle with
  Hull 9 has a D10 Crit Die.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Repair: Repair
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.RepairHint: >-
  Repairing damage to a vehicle requires one or several TECH
  rolls. One roll can be made per Shift. Only one person can
  roll to repair the hull, but others can help.
  Each <span class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span> rolled
  removes one point of damage. If the vehicle was Wrecked,
  it is no longer considered Wrecked once one point of damage
  has been repaired.
  If the engine or a mounted
  weapon has been disabled due to a critical hit, repairing it
  typically requires a TECH roll, in addition to any roll for
  repairing hull damage. The work takes one Shift.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Speeding: Speeding
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.SpeedingHint: >-
  Corresponding to sprinting on foot,
  you can use the speeding action to make additional
  moves in the same Round with a vehicle.
