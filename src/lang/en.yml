FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Sprint: >-
  You can make additional moves in a single Round by using the sprint action.
  This will then count as your action for the Round, meaning you can perform no
  other action. Roll MOBILITY – for each <span
  class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span> rolled, you can make one more move, in
  addition to your free move. If you fail the roll, you fall (before the second
  move) and cannot get up until your next turn.
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Crawl: >-
  If you need to move while being prone, you must crawl. This works like a move
  but counts as your action for the Round. You can get up at the end of your
  crawl (free action).
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.UnarmedAttack: Strength + Close Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.MeleeAttack: Strength + Close Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.Grapple: >-
  If you grapple your opponent as a special attack in close combat, both you and
  your opponent fall to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon they were
  holding and cannot move. The only action they can perform is an attempt to
  break free – which is an action that succeeds if the opponent wins an opposed
  CLOSE COMBAT roll against you. While you are grappling, the only action you
  can perform (until you release your opponent) is a grapple attack. This works
  as a normal unarmed attack, but your target counts as restrained and thus
  cannot defend themselves.
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.BreakFree: Strength + Hand-to-hand Combat
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.ShootFirearm: Agility + Firearms
FLBR.COMBAT_ACTION_HINT.CarefulAim: >-
  If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get
  an advantage to your attack roll. Aiming, however, is an action in itself. You
  cannot aim carefully and fire in the same Round. If you do anything else
  except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or if you are hit by an attack,
  you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another action to aim
  carefully again.

FLBR.SignatureItemUsedCheckboxHint: Used?
FLBR.SomeoneIsSomething: '{name} is {status}'
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Crash: Crash
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.CrashHint: >-
  If a Spinner is Wrecked, it crashes violently to the ground. All people inside
  suffer D3 points of falling damage plus one for each zone of altitude,
  mitigated by the vehicle’s Armor rating. You can also brace yourself for the
  hit by rolling MOBILITY – each <span class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span>
  rolled reduces the damage by one.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.CrashDialog: >-
  This will crash the vehicle and inflict {damage} of falling damage to each
  passenger, mitigated by the vehicle’s Armor rating and a MOBILITY roll (no
  action).
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Explode: Explode
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.ExplodeHint: >-
  The vehicle explodes in a ball of flame. Everyone inside is exposed to a Blast
  Power B explosion, and the vehicle is destroyed beyond repair.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.MassiveCrash: Massive Crash
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Ramming: Ramming
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.RammingHint: >-
  Most vehicles can be used as weapons – i.e. to simply run your target over. It
  counts as a close combat attack but roll for DRIVING instead of CLOSE COMBAT.
  This roll can be combined with the speeding action above, but that will make
  the DRIVING roll an opposed roll, meaning that the effectiveness of the
  speeding might be reduced. The base Damage rating of the attack equals your
  vehicle’s Hull rating divided by two, rounded up. Ramming vehicles inflict
  crushing damage and the Crit Die has a die size equal to the Hull rating,
  rounded up to the closest die, to a maximum of D12 – i.e. a vehicle with Hull
  9 has a D10 Crit Die.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Repair: Repair
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.RepairHint: >-
  Repairing damage to a vehicle requires one or several TECH rolls. One roll can
  be made per Shift. Only one person can roll to repair the hull, but others can
  help. Each <span class="blade-runner-symbols">S</span> rolled removes one
  point of damage. If the vehicle was Wrecked, it is no longer considered
  Wrecked once one point of damage has been repaired. If the engine or a mounted
  weapon has been disabled due to a critical hit, repairing it typically
  requires a TECH roll, in addition to any roll for repairing hull damage. The
  work takes one Shift.
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.Speeding: Speeding
FLBR.VEHICLE.Action.SpeedingHint: >-
  Corresponding to sprinting on foot, you can use the speeding action to make
  additional moves in the same Round with a vehicle.
